# <b>Layout One - Khan Academy</b>
With this layout, we were required to build it using float layout.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

The goal was to replicate a few exisiting websites to learn how to make a float layout in css. While float is not as commonly used in layouts, there are still some companies that have their websites in float and either are either staying there for now or switching their sites over to flex layouts. 

I started by overviewing the design, identifying which sections would be what, created my html and got to work in css. I chose to create a split main section (right and left) and floated them towards each over. 

## Optimizations

I would have enjoyed building the top nav bar out as opposed to just using it as an image. Since this wasn't a working website nor writing script for the page, I opted out to save time. 

## Lessons Learned:

First: I learned about how the headings all have a margin built it. Yay! For the life of me I couldn't figure out why the green line graphic wouldn't move up closer to my heading. 

Secondly: Stumbled upon the 'border-radius' option in css, which really helped me in creating those nice rounded edges for the 'buttons' on the right side.

Lastly: After a very long time of trying to figure out why the code wasn't working, I realized I needed to have my background image in the css file when writing 'background-image'. I feel pretty silly now not realizing that, but alas! Learning everyday :)
